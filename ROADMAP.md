# Circuit Defense — Roadmap

Prioritized backlog for the auto-improver. **OPEN items are the work queue;** the "Shipped"
section is a condensed do-not-re-implement log.

> **Condensed v2.0.0** (owner request: "feedback and roadmap are getting huge — summarize with
> enough detail so future runs don't implement the same thing"). Shipped features are now
> one-liners (`name — vX.Y.Z, one-line what + Test [N]`). Full prose lives in CHANGELOG.md / the
> in-game What's New panel; design rationale + every formula/invariant lives in **CLAUDE.md**
> (the source of truth). When you ship something here, check it off into "Shipped" as a one-liner.

## Known bugs

_None currently known._ (Add any here as found — top priority.)

## OPEN — pick from here (not in priority order; FEEDBACK.md overrides)

### Content & variety
- [ ] **Map: "Crossroads"** — a path that forks and rejoins, or two simultaneous lanes. Bigger
      lift: needs multi-path enemy distribution + targeting/`distToPath` over >1 path. Its own run.
      (All SEVEN static `THEMES` palettes are now claimed as map identities — an 8th *named* map needs a
      brand-new palette; but Crossroads could reuse one or get an 8th.)
- [x] **New single-path map (the 🌀 Vortex)** — DONE v2.25.0 [135], a rectangular inward-spiral kill-funnel
      with a new Neon (hot-magenta) palette (7th map / 7th theme).
- [x] **New tower (the 🔆 Laser)** — DONE v2.9.0 [121], a ramp-up beam (the 10th tower). The
      "charge up the longer it fires" mechanic now exists as a TOWER (was sketched as a Railgun spec idea).
- [x] **Arc/chain tower** — DONE v2.52.0 [193], the ⚛️ Arc (12th tower): a **travelling ricochet bolt**
      (`proj:'ricochet'`) exactly per the design note — hops to the nearest unhit enemy within 150px
      (vs Tesla's 90px instant chain), 5 hits/bolt at 0.85 falloff, low base dmg → spread-swarm sweeper.
      Specs Ball Lightning (+2 hops) / Magnet Coil (seek ×1.6); mastery_arc; 🪩 Pinball Wizard badge.
      Sim: mid-pack at equal gold (w11–12 vs Tesla w10 / Cannon w13). Possible follow-up: a bolt-render
      flourish (zigzag tracer between hops) — the generic orb+trail is used for now.
- [ ] **Tower spec follow-ups** — (a *charge-up* mechanic now exists via the 🔆 Laser tower v2.9.0);
      ~~explosion-penetration vs ⬢ Bastion~~ (DONE as the 💣 Shaped Charges *perk* v2.8.0 [120]; a *spec*
      version is still open if wanted); ~~a counter to blinkers (phantom/cloak/teleporter/veil)~~ (DONE as
      the 👁️ Spectral Sight *perk* v2.41.0 [161] — towers see through intangibility; a per-tower *spec* or
      predictive lead-shot version is still open if wanted). Audit frost (Deep Freeze vs Shatter) & gun
      (Minigun vs AP) for a strictly-dominated option (quick take: both look like healthy axes).
- [ ] **Boss/enemy follow-ups** — a 25th boss archetype (24th = 🚫 Nullifier tower-damage dampening aura,
      shipped v2.53.0 [197], first at w135 — completes the debuff trio after Suppressor/Distorter, −25% dmg,
      freeze-pausable/Hardened-Circuits-negated, brick-red ring; 23rd = 🦎 Chameleon adaptive damage-resistance
      v2.49.0 [186]; 22nd = 💧 Cleanser anti-debuff purge v2.42.0 [164]); per-campaign-tier *fixed* archetypes
      (vs the wave-number cycle); a Breacher variant that costs lives only if it *survives* a tower's range.
      (Color space for boss aura rings is VERY crowded now — a 25th needs a clearly-distinct hue, or reuse a
      shape/glyph cue instead.)
- [ ] **Perk/ability follow-ups** — (revival/comeback legendary 🌅 Phoenix DONE v2.15.0 [125] — cheat death
      once, revive + field-knockback; legendary +40% range 🦅 Eagle Eye DONE v2.3.0 [115]; expanding shock-ring
      render DONE v2.5.0 [117], now also reused on Meteor impact; Barrier-charges talent 🧱 Aegis DONE v2.6.0
      [118]; offensive-buff ability 📣 Amplify DONE v2.48.0 [183] — +30% tower dmg & rate for 5s); a per-tower
      ability; a meta talent version of Capacitor (ability-cooldown — note: ⚡ Surge talent
      already does −6%/rank ability cd, so this would overlap); ~~a Barrier *cooldown*-shortening talent (the
      other Barrier lever, distinct from Aegis's charges)~~ (DONE as 🏯 Rampart talent v2.46.0 [176] — −10%
      Barrier cooldown/rank, max 3); a hidden unlock condition for a secret legendary.
- [ ] **Mayhem wave-mod follow-ups** — a genuinely new *path swap* (direction reverses). (Pool is 23 mods
      after ⚕️ Medic Surge v2.47.0 [181] — heal-aura escort surge; ⏩ Blitz v2.36.0 [147]; ⚑ Herald Surge
      v2.35.0 [144]; most axes covered, so prefer the path-swap idea over another stat-scaler/escort-surge.)
- [x] **In-game Bestiary / Codex** — DONE v2.26.0 [136] (enemies + boss powers) + **v2.28.0** (🛡 Towers
      section: all 11 towers + both specs each, built live from TOWER_TYPES/SPECS so it can't drift). A
      start-menu panel with glyph/colour/first-wave + a one-line counter tip per enemy/boss + role+specs
      per tower. **Mid-run access DONE v2.37.0 [150]** — a 📖 Codex button in the in-game controls + a `C`
      hotkey open it during a run (auto-pauses; closing resumes). A boss-bar / upgrade-panel deep-link to the
      specific entry you're facing is a possible further follow-up.
- [ ] **Per-theme ground textures** — path fills are still solid-colour; add patterns/parallax per theme.

### Balance (simulate before/after, ≤25% per number per run)
- [~] **"Too easy" (recurring owner FEEDBACK)** — raised iteratively. **v2.0.0 added 🌑 Nightmare
      difficulty + a quick-mode `hard`/`nightmare` `lateScale`** (progressive late-game HP, capped) —
      see Shipped. Earlier levers: norm-HP curve, boss-HP slope, boss-armor slope, off-HP enemies
      (Warden/Breacher/Molten/Bastion/Jammer in ALL modes), boss archetypes, economy trims.
      **⚠ CAPPED LEVERS — need owner sign-off before touching (guardrail tests pin them):**
      - **Norm-HP `w^1.9` coeff is at its `1.25` ceiling.** Test `[16]` enforces ≤25% cumulative HP boost
        vs the v1.10.0 (coeff-1.0) baseline at EVERY wave; `1.25` already sits at that asymptote. The old
        "toward ~1.55" aspiration and this invariant are in tension — owner must resolve. Raise late
        difficulty via boss/economy/new-enemy levers, NOT this coeff.
      - **Boss-HP slope (`14 + w*0.6`) can't pass ~0.625** without breaking test `[44]`'s ≤25%-vs-0.5
        invariant. **Boss-armor slope is at `w*0.5`** (test `[44]`; further ≤25% bumps OK).
      - **Archetype threshold w20 can't drop to w15** — test `[45]` pins tutorial bosses (<w20) vanilla.
      - **Quick-mode `lateScale`** — v2.0.0 added a capped early ramp; **v2.31.0 [109] added an UNCAPPED
        DEEP ramp from wave 40** (hard +5%/wave, nightmare +8%/wave; FEEDBACK "way harder as levels
        progress, especially endless — 1.5m unused gold at w140", 25% rule waived). Hard ×2.5 @w65 / ×6.25
        @w140; bosses inherit it proportionally via `t.hp`. Normal/Easy/Campaign exempt so test `[16]`/`[44]`
        stay safe. **v2.32.0 [140] scaled enemy ABILITIES/AURAS with wave depth** — one `enemyMechScale()`
        (`1 + min(0.6, max(0,w−40)·0.015)`, 1.0 ≤w40, cap +60% @w80) feeds regen %, the warden/herald/enrager
        aura radii, summoner add-cap (8→13), and siphon drain. Bounded (no raw HP). **v2.33.0 [141] added the
        deep-wave COUNT ramp** — a shared `waveCount()` helper gives quick-mode hard/nightmare a bounded body
        bump from w40 (`+min(30, floor((w−40)·0.4))`, capped +30 for perf; ~+12% bodies @w140), shared by
        buildWave()+waveComposition() so the preview can't drift. Re-checked the proportional **boss** scaling
        — bosses inherit the deep HP ramp via `t.hp` proportionally (not super-linearly on top), matching the
        owner's "scaled (maybe not as high)" — left as-is. The harder-Endless FEEDBACK thread is now
        **CLOSED** — endless milestone drafts past wave 30 shipped v2.34.0 [142] (the draft loop was gated
        `w < victoryWave()`; Endless's victory wave is 30, so it stopped drafting the moment it went infinite).
      - **Economy lever near-exhausted** (measured v1.24.4): 10-wave war chest ≈2613 gold (≈70% bounty).
        Untrimmed levers move it <2% each → low leverage. Prefer difficulty/tower-power levers.
- [~] **Frost/booster damage snowball** — Shatter ×6→×4.5 (v1.10.0); booster aura power +75%→+65%
      (v1.16.2) + range 90→45 (v1.24.3, area 25% of original, FEEDBACK closed); 🔥 Molten CC-immune
      enemy (v1.77.0) checks freeze-reliant builds from the enemy side. **Remaining (≤25%, sim first):**
      trim Frost Mastery per-rank dmg, or a booster aura soft-cap if a super-booster still solo-carries.
- [~] **Interest/economy curve** — v1.16.1 trimmed bounty/bonus ~13% (10-wave chest). Next if still
      rich: early interest cap 30→~25, or start gold normal 120→100 (each ≤25%, sim). Test [32].
- [ ] **Late-campaign audit (L30–40)** — confirm hard-but-beatable with a maxed meta.

### Game feel / polish
- [x] **Start-menu revamp (FEEDBACK [high])** — DONE v2.1.0 [113]. The "full revamp" landed: a desktop
      two-column dashboard (config card left + a right rail stacking play actions over a vertical utility
      panel) so the menu fits the board with ▶ PLAY on-screen (it was below the fold). Nine slices total
      (button hierarchy v1.39.1 → accent tiles v2.0.2 → dashboard v2.1.0). FEEDBACK item moved to DONE.
- [ ] **What's New flush polish** — the panel butts against `#gameCol`'s right edge, ~21px wider than
      the canvas (driven by `.hint` margins) → minor cosmetic gap. Could constrain column width to canvas.
- [ ] **Small polish follow-ups** — (~~slide-in animation on overlay buttons~~ DONE v2.38.0 — overlay
      buttons rise + fade in, reduced-motion-gated; ~~a quick-restart hotkey, e.g.
      Enter on the game-over overlay~~ DONE v2.37.0 [150] — Enter → Play Again when offered);
      ~~hide the faint between-wave `Next:` preview while the upgrade panel is open~~ (DONE v2.29.0 [138]);
      ~~highlight the beaten Records cell when next opened~~ (DONE v2.22.0 [132] — latest-PB cell tinted gold + ★);
      ~~a per-kind hover tooltip~~ (DONE v2.52.0 [194] — hovering a Next:-strip kind disc pops its
      Bestiary name + counter tip from CODEX_ENEMIES) (~~DPS-relative read on the wave-threat number~~
      DONE v2.29.0 [138] — board DPS 🗡 shown beside the ⚔ threat HP via `boardDps()`);
      ~~visible grid lines (not just dots) + a "snap" tick sound~~ (DONE v2.24.0 [134] — full grid lines +
      target-cell highlight + a `SFX.tick()` on cell-cross while placing);
      ~~combo-tier label~~ (DONE v2.36.0 [148] — the meter shouts HEATING UP→RAMPAGE→UNSTOPPABLE→GODLIKE) +
      ~~combo-tier shape~~ (DONE v2.39.0 [156] — an escalating star-burst above the tier word);
      ~~high-contrast mode~~ (DONE v2.38.0 [151] — ◐ Settings toggle, bold dual-halo enemy outlines);
      ~~wave-start announcement banner~~ (DONE v2.44.0 [170] — centered "WAVE N" / "☠ BOSS WAVE N" flash);
      ~~sell-selected-tower hotkey~~ (DONE v2.44.0 [172] — press S, mirrors the U upgrade hotkey);
      ~~cycle-target-mode hotkey~~ (DONE v2.46.0 [178] — press D, mirrors U/S, non-buff only);
      ~~speed-toggle hotkey~~ (DONE v2.53.0 [196] — press F, cycles 1×→2×→3×, mirrors the ⏩ button);
      ~~low-lives danger cue~~ (DONE v2.48.0 [184] — red screen-edge vignette pulsing as lives fall);
      per-achievement chip reward (needs a chip-economy pass first); toast/sound when a badge unlocks mid-menu.
      (Veterancy visual thread now COMPLETE: lifetime tower-kills stat + 🏵️ Living Legend badge v2.19.0 [129],
      rank-tinted barrels v2.21.0 [131].)

### Tech / tooling
- [x] **Split `cd-update.js`** — DONE v2.15.2. The end-of-run + meta-UI half (achievements/records/settings/
      scoring/end-screen + endGame/winGame/nextLevel/quitRun/continueEndless) moved verbatim into a new
      **`cd-endgame.js`** (491 lines), loaded after cd-update.js, before cd-render.js. cd-update.js dropped
      **1448 → 963** (now just the per-frame `update()` sim + combat: pickTarget/fire*/hitEnemy/damage). Zero
      behaviour change (suite 1339→1342, +3 from the new file's coverage); HTML/sw.js/harness/CLAUDE.md updated
      in the same run. All 8 game files now have comfortable headroom (largest: cd-render 984, cd-game 909).
- [ ] **Split the test harness file** — `tests/run-tests.mjs` is **~12,165 lines (182 groups, 1869
      assertions)**, by far the largest file in the repo, growing ~55 lines/run. Could split per-group into
      `tests/groups/*.mjs` with a small runner. Dev-only, suite green ~35s. Worth doing before it doubles.
- [ ] **Watch: `cd-update.js` size** — largest game file at **1235 lines** (vs the ~1500 cap), growing
      ~15-25 lines per new boss archetype (its per-frame tick block). Comfortable headroom (~10+ more
      archetypes), but if it nears ~1400, split the combat helpers (pickTarget/fire*/hitEnemy/damage) into
      a `cd-combat.js` — the same domain-split pattern that produced cd-endgame.js (v2.15.2).
- [x] **Expand harness coverage** — ~~abilities (meteor/freeze/rush/shock/barrier)~~ DONE v2.37.0 [149];
      ~~spec selection at L5~~ DONE v2.39.0 [157]; ~~mayhem path-shift on resume~~ DONE v2.40.0 [160]
      (resumed Mayhem run regenerates the path, relocates towers, restores wave/towers, drives a wave).
      (Campaign next-level flow covered by [109].) ~~Daily-seed cross-page determinism~~ DONE v2.46.0 [179]
      (two fresh pages produce the identical date-seeded challenge — a guard against Date.now()/Math.random()
      slipping into the seeded stream). Note: Daily runs are one-off / not resumable by design, so this is
      cross-page-load determinism, not save-resume.
- [ ] **Audit tests for draft-RNG flakiness** — the harness auto-picks draft card `[0]`; any test asserting
      a numeric gold/dmg bound *after* a draft can flake if a gold/power perk lands in slot 0. v1.20.2 fixed
      group [32] by asserting the pre-draft economy. Sweep other run-driving groups; pin to pre-draft/perk-neutral.
- [x] **Harden the vacuous fire-path perk tests** — DONE v2.51.0. Retrofitted `[93]` Ambush, `[167]` Finisher and
      `[174]` Point Blank: they now place tower + a stationary (`spd:0`) enemy ON the path via `pointAt` and assert
      `railBestHit===1` (a fire guard), so the rail actually lands and the ×1.3/×1.35/×1.25 ratios test real
      damage (they used to hold trivially at 0 because `update()` shoved the mock enemy off the beam). Point Blank
      varies the *tower's* geometric offset from a fixed on-path enemy. Mirrors the good `[188]` pattern.

## Shipped (condensed — do NOT re-implement; check CLAUDE.md for detail)

### Towers / specs / targeting
- 12 towers (gun/sniper/frost/cannon/tesla/poison + Mortar v1.23.0 [42] + Railgun v1.83.0 [91] + Laser
  v2.9.0 [121] + Pulsar v2.23.0 [133] + Arc v2.52.0 [193]); a new tower is mostly additive (`TOWER_TYPES`+`SPECS`+optional mastery talent). Mortar
  lobbed-arc render v1.79.0 [87]. Laser = a ramp-up beam (×1→×2.2 on a held target, resets on switch) —
  sustained boss/tank DPS, poor at swarms; specs Focusing Array/Pulse Drive; hotkey `0`; mastery_laser.
  Pulsar = a self-centred radial AoE pulse (`proj:'nova'`, hits ALL in range at once, low per-hit dmg →
  swarm-clearer, poor vs bosses; the inverse of the Laser); specs Overload/Resonance; no number hotkey; mastery_pulsar.
  Arc = a travelling ricochet bolt (`proj:'ricochet'`, hops to the nearest unhit enemy ≤150px, 5 hits/bolt,
  0.85 falloff → spread-swarm sweeper, weak single-target); specs Ball Lightning/Magnet Coil; no number hotkey; mastery_arc.
- 9 targeting modes (first/last/strong/close + Weak v1.70.0 [80] + Support v1.49.0 [66] + Fastest v2.41.0 [163]
  + Boss v2.45.0 [173] + Cluster v2.53.0 [195] — aims at the densest knot for max AoE splash); default-mode
  device pref v1.89.0 [97]. Spec rework v1.10.0 (Network/Mega/Poison), Executioner buff v1.26.0,
  Superconductor falloff 0.7→0.8 v1.55.0 [17]. Railgun Penetrator nerfed +35%→+20% v2.0.0 [109].
- Tower veterancy (cosmetic kill-rank pips) v1.100.0 [107].

### Enemies / bosses / waves
- 13 enemy kinds (+boss): + heal/shield/split/molten(v1.77.0 [86])/phantom(v1.9.0 [14])/bastion(v1.90.0 [98])/
  warden(v1.35.0 [52])/jammer(v1.91.0 [99])/breacher(v1.63.0 [74], leak-cost 2→3 v2.0.0)/herald(v2.4.0 [116],
  haste-aura, Enrager's regular-enemy cousin). Concurrent waves (cap 3→8 v2.34.0 [20], FEEDBACK) v1.12.0.
- 24 boss archetypes from w20+ (regen→summoner→bulwark→enrager→teleporter→berserker→disruptor→juggernaut→
  siphon→hydra→revenant→conduit→warper→fortifier→warlord→suppressor→absorber→distorter→custodian→veil→accelerator→cleanser→adaptive→nullifier) v1.25.0–v2.53.0 [45]/[53]/[90]/[96]/[114]/[119]/[122]/[124]/[126]/[137]/[139]/[143]/[146]/[162]/[164]/[186]/[197]; boss-bar mechanic badge v1.36.0 [53]. Nullifier (v2.53.0 [197], first w135) dampens nearby tower DAMAGE −25% (the effDmg sibling of Suppressor's rate / Distorter's range; freeze-pausable, Hardened-Circuits-negated, adds no HP). Chameleon (v2.49.0 [186], first w130) throttles a repeated same-tower-type hit −50% (a build-diversity axis; freeze lifts it, adds no HP). Absorber (v2.27.0 [137]) caps per-hit damage at maxHp×5% (checks burst/crit builds; freeze lifts the cap). Distorter (v2.30.0 [139]) dampens nearby tower range −20% (the `fog` mod as a boss; freeze-counterable). Custodian (v2.35.0 [143]) shields its cohort −40% (the ◈ Warden's aura as a boss; freeze/focus-counterable). Veil (v2.36.0 [146], first w115) cloaks its cohort — nearby allies periodically phase out untargetable (the Cloaking Field mod / phantom as a boss; freeze/rapid-fire-counterable). Accelerator (v2.41.0 [162], first w120) ramps its own speed with time alive (up to +80%; a pure DPS-race lever, freeze pauses the ramp, adds no HP). Cleanser (v2.42.0 [164], first w125) purges poison/slow from itself + cohort every ~2.5s (an anti-debuff axis; freeze pauses it, adds no HP).
- 23 Mayhem wave mods (frenzy/blitz/swarm/titans/goldrush/drought/surge/fog/armored/brownout/regen/emp/wardens/
  adrenaline/heatwave/cloak/fission/breachers/jammers/bastions/heralds/medics/meteors) [46]+ many; Herald Surge v2.35.0 [144]; Blitz (+60% speed, the "double-time" Frenzy variant) v2.36.0 [147]; Medic Surge (heal-aura escort surge) v2.47.0 [181].

  Finisher(+35% dmg to enemies below 40% HP — the closer bookend to Ambush's opener, v2.43.0 [167])/
  Point Blank(+25% dmg to enemies within half a tower's range — a positional axis, v2.45.0 [174])/

  + **📣 Amplify v2.48.0 [183]** — the first offensive-BUFF ability: +30% tower dmg & fire rate for 5s, cd 55, hotkey Y).
- 7 quick maps (classic/spiral/serpent + gauntlet v1.54.0 [68] + cascade v1.87.0 [95] + nexus v1.98.0 [105]
  + vortex v2.25.0 [135], inward-spiral funnel + Neon theme — 7th static palette);
  per-map themes v1.13.8 [28]. Campaign 40 levels; **auto-level-select v2.0.0** [109].

  banks the wave-30 win once then continues with no victory wall; resumable; additive save field (old saves → false).
  **Milestone drafts continue past wave 30** v2.34.0 [142] (FEEDBACK — they used to stop at the victory wave).

### Tech / tooling (done)
- Domain-split into 7 `cd-*.js` classic scripts v1.8.1/v1.8.2 [12] (NEVER ES modules). GitHub Actions CI v1.71.1
  (headless Playwright on push/PR; independent of Pages deploy; no build step).
- Menu-revamp slices (COMPLETE, FEEDBACK closed v2.1.0): button hierarchy v1.39.1 [58] · PLAY sheen v1.41.0 [59] ·
  config card v1.42.0 [60] · hero header v1.45.0 [63] · ambient backdrop v1.69.0 [79] · hover polish v1.94.0 [102] ·
  grouped toolbar v2.0.0 · accent tiles v2.0.2 [112] · **dashboard layout v2.1.0 [113]** ·
  **full-column overlay v2.18.0 [128]** (FEEDBACK: menu moved to `#gameCol` so it spans the whole
  game height — campaign's 40-level grid no longer overflows into a scrollbar; `backToMenu` no longer
  hardcodes `display:flex` over the desktop grid).

## Vetoed by owner — do not re-add

_(Reverts / owner undo-commits land here with hash + one-liner. Never reintroduce these or anything
substantially similar without written owner request.)_

- None recorded yet. (Commit `4a66ba3` removed the **Scrapper** perk and cut rare draft chance to 14% —
  a routine maintainer balance commit, not an owner veto, but treat Scrapper's removal as intentional:
  don't re-add it without justification.)

## Prompt suggestions for the owner

_(The routine forbids the agent from editing its own scheduled-task instruction file, so process-change
requests land here for the owner to paste in.)_

- **Make visual verification a permanent health-check step** (owner FEEDBACK, done ad-hoc v1.14.1; can't
  durably codify it since editing the scheduled-task SKILL.md is blocked). Add a step **5** to the
  "Health check run" section of `circuit-defense-auto-improver/SKILL.md`:

  > 5. **Visual verification** — confirm the game *looks right and is playable* on **both a large display
  >    (≥1280px) and a phone (≤430px)** using the preview tools. `preview_screenshot` times out on this
  >    game (the rAF loop keeps the page busy), so verify layout with `preview_inspect` bounding-box /
  >    computed-style reads + `preview_eval`. At each size assert: no horizontal page overflow; every menu
  >    (talents/achievements/records/settings/start/overlay/draft) opens on-screen and scrolls; What's New
  >    sits where intended; an in-game quick run shows canvas + HUD + shop + controls within the viewport
  >    with a board that isn't uselessly tiny. File precise px measurements to ROADMAP for anything wrong;
  >    clean up test state afterwards.

- **Resolve the norm-HP-curve tension** — the encoded test-`[16]` invariant (≤25% vs the coeff-1.0 baseline,
  which pins the `w^1.9` coeff at `1.25`) conflicts with the old aspiration to push toward "~1.55". Decide
  one: keep the invariant (raise late difficulty only via boss/economy/new-content levers) or rebaseline it.
