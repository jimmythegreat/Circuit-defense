# Circuit Defense — Roadmap

Prioritized backlog for the auto-improver. **OPEN items are the work queue;** the "Shipped"
section is a condensed do-not-re-implement log.

> **Condensed v2.0.0** (owner request: "feedback and roadmap are getting huge — summarize with
> enough detail so future runs don't implement the same thing"). Shipped features are now
> one-liners (`name — vX.Y.Z, one-line what + Test [N]`). Full prose lives in CHANGELOG.md / the
> in-game What's New panel; design rationale + every formula/invariant lives in **CLAUDE.md**
> (the source of truth). When you ship something here, check it off into "Shipped" as a one-liner.

## Known bugs

_None currently known._ (Add any here as found — top priority.)

## OPEN — pick from here (not in priority order; FEEDBACK.md overrides)

### Content & variety
- [ ] **Map: "Crossroads"** — a path that forks and rejoins, or two simultaneous lanes. Bigger
      lift: needs multi-path enemy distribution + targeting/`distToPath` over >1 path. Its own run.
      (All SIX static `THEMES` palettes are now claimed as map identities — a 7th *named* map needs a
      brand-new palette; but Crossroads could reuse one or get a 7th.)
- [x] **New tower (the 🔆 Laser)** — DONE v2.9.0 [121], a ramp-up beam (the 10th tower). The
      "charge up the longer it fires" mechanic now exists as a TOWER (was sketched as a Railgun spec idea).
- [ ] **Arc/chain tower** — chain-lightning that *bounces* between nearby enemies (a swarm counter,
      distinct from Tesla's fixed-target chain AND the Laser's single-target ramp). The remaining "new tower" idea.
- [ ] **Tower spec follow-ups** — (a *charge-up* mechanic now exists via the 🔆 Laser tower v2.9.0);
      ~~explosion-penetration vs ⬢ Bastion~~ (DONE as the 💣 Shaped Charges *perk* v2.8.0 [120]; a *spec*
      version is still open if wanted); a predictive lead-shot spec to counter blinkers
      (phantom/cloak/teleporter). Audit frost (Deep Freeze vs Shatter) & gun (Minigun vs AP) for a
      strictly-dominated option (quick take: both look like healthy axes).
- [ ] **Boss/enemy follow-ups** — a 15th boss archetype (14th = 🟫 Fortifier armor-ramp, shipped v2.10.0
      [122]); per-campaign-tier *fixed* archetypes (vs the wave-number cycle); a Breacher variant that
      costs lives only if it *survives* a tower's range.
- [ ] **Perk/ability follow-ups** — (legendary +40% range 🦅 Eagle Eye DONE v2.3.0 [115]; expanding shock-ring
      render DONE v2.5.0 [117], now also reused on Meteor impact; Barrier-charges talent 🧱 Aegis DONE v2.6.0
      [118]); a per-tower ability; a meta talent version of Capacitor (ability-cooldown — note: ⚡ Surge talent
      already does −6%/rank ability cd, so this would overlap); a Barrier *cooldown*-shortening talent (the
      other Barrier lever, distinct from Aegis's charges); a hidden unlock condition for a secret legendary.
- [ ] **Mayhem wave-mod follow-ups** — a genuinely new *path swap* (direction reverses); a stronger
      ×1.6 double-speed variant of `frenzy`. (Pool is 20 mods; most axes covered.)
- [ ] **Per-theme ground textures** — path fills are still solid-colour; add patterns/parallax per theme.

### Balance (simulate before/after, ≤25% per number per run)
- [~] **"Too easy" (recurring owner FEEDBACK)** — raised iteratively. **v2.0.0 added 🌑 Nightmare
      difficulty + a quick-mode `hard`/`nightmare` `lateScale`** (progressive late-game HP, capped) —
      see Shipped. Earlier levers: norm-HP curve, boss-HP slope, boss-armor slope, off-HP enemies
      (Warden/Breacher/Molten/Bastion/Jammer in ALL modes), boss archetypes, economy trims.
      **⚠ CAPPED LEVERS — need owner sign-off before touching (guardrail tests pin them):**
      - **Norm-HP `w^1.9` coeff is at its `1.25` ceiling.** Test `[16]` enforces ≤25% cumulative HP boost
        vs the v1.10.0 (coeff-1.0) baseline at EVERY wave; `1.25` already sits at that asymptote. The old
        "toward ~1.55" aspiration and this invariant are in tension — owner must resolve. Raise late
        difficulty via boss/economy/new-enemy levers, NOT this coeff.
      - **Boss-HP slope (`14 + w*0.6`) can't pass ~0.625** without breaking test `[44]`'s ≤25%-vs-0.5
        invariant. **Boss-armor slope is at `w*0.5`** (test `[44]`; further ≤25% bumps OK).
      - **Archetype threshold w20 can't drop to w15** — test `[45]` pins tutorial bosses (<w20) vanilla.
      - **Quick-mode `lateScale` (v2.0.0)** is the newest late lever (hard cap +25%, nightmare cap +40%);
        Normal/Easy/Campaign exempt so test `[16]` stays safe. Room to tune the ramp ≤25%/run.
      - **Economy lever near-exhausted** (measured v1.24.4): 10-wave war chest ≈2613 gold (≈70% bounty).
        Untrimmed levers move it <2% each → low leverage. Prefer difficulty/tower-power levers.
- [~] **Frost/booster damage snowball** — Shatter ×6→×4.5 (v1.10.0); booster aura power +75%→+65%
      (v1.16.2) + range 90→45 (v1.24.3, area 25% of original, FEEDBACK closed); 🔥 Molten CC-immune
      enemy (v1.77.0) checks freeze-reliant builds from the enemy side. **Remaining (≤25%, sim first):**
      trim Frost Mastery per-rank dmg, or a booster aura soft-cap if a super-booster still solo-carries.
- [~] **Interest/economy curve** — v1.16.1 trimmed bounty/bonus ~13% (10-wave chest). Next if still
      rich: early interest cap 30→~25, or start gold normal 120→100 (each ≤25%, sim). Test [32].
- [ ] **Late-campaign audit (L30–40)** — confirm hard-but-beatable with a maxed meta.

### Game feel / polish
- [x] **Start-menu revamp (FEEDBACK [high])** — DONE v2.1.0 [113]. The "full revamp" landed: a desktop
      two-column dashboard (config card left + a right rail stacking play actions over a vertical utility
      panel) so the menu fits the board with ▶ PLAY on-screen (it was below the fold). Nine slices total
      (button hierarchy v1.39.1 → accent tiles v2.0.2 → dashboard v2.1.0). FEEDBACK item moved to DONE.
- [ ] **What's New flush polish** — the panel butts against `#gameCol`'s right edge, ~21px wider than
      the canvas (driven by `.hint` margins) → minor cosmetic gap. Could constrain column width to canvas.
- [ ] **Small polish follow-ups** — slide-in animation on overlay buttons + a quick-restart hotkey (R);
      hide the faint between-wave `Next:` preview while the upgrade panel is open; highlight the beaten
      Records cell when next opened; a per-kind hover tooltip + DPS-relative read on the wave-threat number;
      visible grid lines (not just dots) + a "snap" tick sound; combo-tier shape/label + high-contrast mode;
      lifetime cross-run "tower kills" meta stat/badge + rank-tinted barrel colour (veterancy follow-up);
      per-achievement chip reward (needs a chip-economy pass first); toast/sound when a badge unlocks mid-menu.

### Tech / tooling
- [ ] **Watch `cd-update.js` size** — at **1318 lines** (health check v2.5.1), the largest game file and
      closest to the ~1500 cap, growing ~20–40 lines/run (new enemies/perks/bosses land their tick logic here).
      No split needed yet (~180 lines headroom); when it crosses ~1500, split it by domain (e.g. enemy-AI tick
      vs combat/`damage()` vs end-game/`computeScore`) as its own zero-behaviour-change run. Other files have room
      (cd-render 958, cd-game 901).
- [ ] **Split the test harness file** — `tests/run-tests.mjs` is **~8,050 lines (117 groups, 1255
      assertions)**, by far the largest file in the repo, growing ~50 lines/run. Could split per-group into
      `tests/groups/*.mjs` with a small runner. Dev-only, suite green ~30s. Worth doing before it doubles.
- [ ] **Expand harness coverage** — abilities (meteor/freeze/rush/shock/barrier), spec selection at L5,
      mayhem path-shift on resume. (Campaign next-level flow now covered by [109].)
- [ ] **Audit tests for draft-RNG flakiness** — the harness auto-picks draft card `[0]`; any test asserting
      a numeric gold/dmg bound *after* a draft can flake if a gold/power perk lands in slot 0. v1.20.2 fixed
      group [32] by asserting the pre-draft economy. Sweep other run-driving groups; pin to pre-draft/perk-neutral.

## Vetoed by owner — do not re-add

_(Reverts / owner undo-commits land here with hash + one-liner. Never reintroduce these or anything
substantially similar without written owner request.)_

- None recorded yet. (Commit `4a66ba3` removed the **Scrapper** perk and cut rare draft chance to 14% —
  a routine maintainer balance commit, not an owner veto, but treat Scrapper's removal as intentional:
  don't re-add it without justification.)

## Prompt suggestions for the owner

_(The routine forbids the agent from editing its own scheduled-task instruction file, so process-change
requests land here for the owner to paste in.)_

- **Make visual verification a permanent health-check step** (owner FEEDBACK, done ad-hoc v1.14.1; can't
  durably codify it since editing the scheduled-task SKILL.md is blocked). Add a step **5** to the
  "Health check run" section of `circuit-defense-auto-improver/SKILL.md`:

  > 5. **Visual verification** — confirm the game *looks right and is playable* on **both a large display
  >    (≥1280px) and a phone (≤430px)** using the preview tools. `preview_screenshot` times out on this
  >    game (the rAF loop keeps the page busy), so verify layout with `preview_inspect` bounding-box /
  >    computed-style reads + `preview_eval`. At each size assert: no horizontal page overflow; every menu
  >    (talents/achievements/records/settings/start/overlay/draft) opens on-screen and scrolls; What's New
  >    sits where intended; an in-game quick run shows canvas + HUD + shop + controls within the viewport
  >    with a board that isn't uselessly tiny. File precise px measurements to ROADMAP for anything wrong;
  >    clean up test state afterwards.

- **Resolve the norm-HP-curve tension** — the encoded test-`[16]` invariant (≤25% vs the coeff-1.0 baseline,
  which pins the `w^1.9` coeff at `1.25`) conflicts with the old aspiration to push toward "~1.55". Decide
  one: keep the invariant (raise late difficulty only via boss/economy/new-content levers) or rebaseline it.
